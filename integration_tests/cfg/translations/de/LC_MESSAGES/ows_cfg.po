#. (Version 2.1.5) includes observations taken from 1986 to the present, from
#. the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites. WOfS covers all of mainland Australia and
#. Tasmania but excludes off-shore Territories. The WOfS product allows users
#. to get a better understanding of where water is normally present in a
#. landscape, where water is seldom observed, and where inundation has occurred
#. occasionally. Data is provided as Water Observation Feature Layers (WOFLs),
#. in a 1 to 1 relationship with the input satellite data. Hence there is one
#. WOFL for each satellite dataset processed for the occurrence of water. The
#. details of the WOfS algorithm and derived statistics are available at
